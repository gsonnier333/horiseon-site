Horiseon Website Code Refactor

For this project, my goal was to make changes to the html and css of an existing homepage for "Horiseon" to improve what's already there without changing the overall presentation of the site. The only changes that might affect a user's experience with the website were adding an appropriate title as well as alt attributes for all of the images. The changes beyond that were meant to make the code easier to read. To do this, I replaced a number of div tags in the html file with semantic tags that better describe their function and purpose within the page, then I consolidated identicals ids in the css file to prevent bloat and added comments to help with finding/identifying specific parts of the code in the future. By completing this project, I got some experience working with semantic html tags, learned about writing good alt text for images, and was able to see how the css on a page like this translates to what the user sees when they load it. I also learned you can use span tags to modify the styling of certain text in the middle of a word/line, which is a neat trick I may want to use in the future.
